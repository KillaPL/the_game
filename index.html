      So that's what is going on here:
      <br>
      A bunch of people decided to build a small village:
      <br>
      Currently, a leader, woodcutter, fisherman and 2 gatherers.
      <br>
      They eat berries from ground, they catch fishes and cook them, they drink water from the river
      <br>
      And they have to sleep.
      <br>
      They also are building their first construction, a dormitory in which they then sleep.
      <br>
      The tiles mean:
      <br>
      "~" -> river
      <br>
      "." -> regular, empty field
      <br>
      "t" -> tree
      <br>
      "#" -> berries bush
      <br>
      blue rectangle -> dormitory being built
      <br>
      brown rectangle -> done dormitory
      <br>
      "L" -> leader
      <br>
      "W" -> woodcutter
      <br>
      "F" -> fisherman
      <br>
      "G" -> gatherer
      <br>
      ALSO:
